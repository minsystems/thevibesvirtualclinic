            THE VIBESVIRTUAL CLINIC OVERVIEW
            </h3>

            <p class="mb-3 lead">
            The Platform is owned and operated by The VibesVirtual Clinic, a company registered in Nigeria (company number …………).
            The VibesVirtual Clinic provides individuals to connect in real time, via phone calls, chat and instant messaging to participating health professionals (all of whom are registered) via the Platform for you to gain qualified and professional medical advice and be provided with related administrative services including referrals. If agreed with a Specialist, and where supported by The VibesVirtual Clinic, in consultation on the Platform, Customers may also purchase private prescriptions for certain medication(s).
            The VibesVirtual Clinic may vary charges for any Services at any time, and changes will be notified to you in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
            You expressly understand, accept and agree that when using the Platform, the Practitioners are independent medical professionals that are individually responsible for the medical advice they offer to you via the Platform.
            The VibesVirtual Clinic is a linking platform that enables customers to consult with Health Professionals on a private and self-pay basis from time to time. You will be presented with your options regarding medical record sharing before you start your first consultation on the Platform and the choice to share your medical records is entirely yours.
            Prescriptions will only be issued by Practitioners under circumstances that are appropriate and legal, based on discussion and mutual agreement between you and the Practitioner.
            The VibesVirtual Clinic will make all reasonable endeavours to connect you to Practitioners, subject to minimum specification requirements which are determined by us from time to time.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3 lead">
            Consultation times are subject to change and are only made available to Customers at the sole discretion of The VibesVirtual Clinic. If you require medical advice and The VibesVirtual Clinic is inaccessible or there are no appointments available to suit you; you miss an appointment you have made or start a connection that fails; or attend an appointment that has been cancelled or when a Practitioner is not available, understand and agree that it is your sole responsibility to seek appropriate alternative medical advice from alternative service providers, that you are registered with.
            Furthermore, The VibesVirtual Clinic and the Health Professionals are not responsible for any legal prescriptions given to you which Registered Pharmacies refuse to dispense. You accept that it remains an individual Pharmacist’s right to refuse to fulfil any prescription and/or dispense medications when presented with a legal prescription. None of this affects your legal rights.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-uppercase heading border-bottom mb-4">
